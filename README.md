## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Something interesting I learned from this project was using flex:1 flex:1 on multiple elements only sets the scaling for the elements originally, and any margin/border/padding added to either element will disrupt the scaling.
